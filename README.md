# OnlineShopperClickstreamAnalysis

With the growing demand of websites to capitalize on the conversion of users, several questions are posed in the field of marketing research to see if machine learning can improve the personalization of ecommerce websites and further increase the economic value generated from these websites. The purpose of this literature review is to see how clickstream data has been leveraged through various sources to answer our research questions: 
Can Standard Machine Learning classification models accurately predict whether a user will make a purchase or not?
How can users be grouped to assist marketing teams in tailoring content for each group? 
How can machine learning-driven real-time recommendation algorithms enhance user session quality?
This review analyzes aggregated sessions data–including time spent on the website, page categories visited and browser specific variables– to uncover actionable insights into user behaviour and user intent. The study aims to equip marketing teams with analytics that drive revenue and assess user purchasing intent while effectively segmenting customers for targeted content recommendations that improve the overall web experience. Using the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset, derived from user interactions from Google Analytics. The dataset consists of 12,330 online users sessions with 1908 (15.5%) resulting in a purchase (Sakar, C. & Kastro, Y. 2018). The dataset’s 17 features provide insight into user engagement patterns including page views, time spent on page categories, with the target variable, revenue, directly supporting segmentation for revenue-boosting strategies. By identifying purchase likelihood and pinpointing user groups that tailor content, this research aims to provide marketers with the tools to optimise user experiences, enhance the customer journey, and ultimately drive higher conversion rates.
